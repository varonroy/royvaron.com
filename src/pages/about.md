## Myself

My name is Roy Varon Weinryb. I am a software developer who focuses on AI and ML. In this website I showcase some of my projects and some articles that I wrote. My main languages are Rust, Python, Java and C/C++.

## Education

I have a B.S degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston where I graduated _Magna Cum Laude_: a double major in Physics and CS, and a minor in mathematics.

## Experience

During 2021-2022 I worked at a fintech startup company - Applied Matrix. My role was developing and optimizing a AI finance related simulation. During that time I have gained experience in Rust (the language the simulation was written in) and python (the language used for visualization and deep-learning).

During 2022-2023 I worked at a energy startup company - Ageera. At Ageera I have had my hands on every aspect of the development process. From the backend to the frontend, to data-science.
