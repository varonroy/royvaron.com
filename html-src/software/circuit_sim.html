				Introduction
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				A circuit simulator is a program that takes a representation of a circuit and solves for all the
				currents
				and voltages as a function of time.
			</div>

			<!-- Circuit Elements -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Circuit Elements
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				In the code, a circuit element is represented with three properties: a positive node, a negative node,
				and a current.
				Each of these properties has a unique index that is assigned as the circuit element is created. By
				convention, the
				current flows from the positive node to the negative node.
			</div>

			<!-- Circuit -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Circuit
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				The circuit is a class that includes a list of all the circuit elements, and can create new circuit
				elements.
				The circuit is also responsible for all the pre processing that need to be done before the circuit can
				be solved.
			</div>

			<!-- Circuit System -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Circuit System
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				This class can take certain "features" such as ohm's law or voltage sources and convert them into a
				linear system of equations
				that can be solved with various techniques of linear algebra.
			</div>

			<!-- Connecting Elements -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Connecting Elements
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				As mentioned before, the positive and negative terminals of each element have unique indices. That means
				that we need an object
				that will automatically manage a collection of sets that would represent the groups of the nodes that
				are connected to each other.
				<br />
				This operation will be implemented by a data structure that is called Union Find.
			</div>

			<!-- UnionFind -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				UnionFind
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				UnionFind is a data structure that represents a collection of sets. Given a set of numbers, and the
				union of these numbers, UnionFind
				will keep track of which numbers are in the same union.
				<br />
				This is similar to how sets work but there is an important distinction. Applying a union to two sets
				could be described by "add all numbers
				from set A and set B to set C" (assuming no duplicates which is the case here). While UnionFind would be
				the following: "find the sets that
				contain the numbers a and b and combine these two sets."
				<br />
				Here is an example:

				Connecting Elements - API
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				Connecting two elements is accomplished by applying union on the negative terminal of the first element
				with the positive terminal of the second element.

				Once the circuit is fully connected, a unique voltage index can be assigned to each group in the node's
				UnionFind's union.

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				Once the circuit has finished pre processing, it has a list of currents and voltages. These currents and
				voltages will be the unknowns in the circuit system's
				system of linear equations.
				<br />
				Then, the circuit will loop over each element and add the equation that describes the element to system.
				For example:
				<br />
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-1"></div>
					<div class="col-5">
						Resistor
					</div>
					<div class="col-5">
						\[ V_i - V_j - I_kR = 0 \]
					</div>
					<div class="col-1"></div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-1"></div>
					<div class="col-5">
						Voltage Source
					</div>
					<div class="col-5">
						\[ V_i = V_s \]

					<div class="col-1"></div>

				By this point the code is rich enough to be able to solve any combination of resistors, voltage sources,
				and current sources.
				<br />
				Here is an example. On the left there is the code that builds the circuit. On the right there is a
				diagram of the circuit. And on the bottom
				there is the resulting system of equations and the solutions.

			<!-- Capacitors -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Capacitors
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				Capacitors are more complex than the previous elements we have dealt with. Opposed to sources and
				resistors, the capacitor's equation is differential.
				This means that even in a DC circuit, the solution will be time dependent.
				\[ I = C\frac{dV}{dt} \]
				The circuit solver doesn't have "access" to the derivative \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) because it is not one of
				the knowns or the unknowns in the system's matrix.
				Furthermore it cannot approximate it numerically because that would require to know the value of the
				voltage in the next time step. However, at each point in time, the circuit
				does have the value of the current.
				<br />
				For this reason, the circuit will model the capacitor as a voltage source, and at each time step it will
				perform numerical integration over the current in order to update the voltage.
				\[ V = \frac{1}{C} \int_0^tIdt' \]
				The numerical integration will be implemented as a recurrence relation
				\[ V_{n+1} = V_n + \frac{1}{C} I\Delta t \]
				It is important to notice here that this recurrence relation reaches its final value when \(I=0\) which
				is exactly what happens with capacitors in real life - they become open circuits.
			</div>

			<!-- Inductors -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Inductors
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				The idea behind inductors is the same as with capacitors. Starting with the linear differential
				equation:
				\[ V = L\frac{dI}{dt} \]
				Rewriting it as an integral:
				\[ I = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^tVdt' \]
				Which then can be converted to a recurrence relation:
				\[ I_{n+1} = I_n + \frac{1}{L} V\Delta t \]
				Inductors are modeled as current sources.
			</div>

			<!-- Time Dependent Circuit Solver -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Time Dependent Circuit Solver
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				As mention before Capacitors and Inductors are modeled as Sources whose values change in time. The
				circuit solver, however, can solve the system at a specific point in time.
				<br />
				This means that after each solution, we need to update these special sources, increment the time counter
				forward and solve again the system with the updated values.
			</div>

			<!-- Example: RLC circuit -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Example: RLC circuit
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				Here is an example. On the left - the code that builds the circuit. On the right - the circuit's
				diagram.
				And on the bottom - the resulting system of equations and the solutions at several time steps.


				<div class="overflow-auto h-42 w-11/12 mx-auto border my-5 p-2">
					<pre><code>{{@ software/circuit_sim/rlc_code}}</code></pre>

			<!-- Adaptive Time Steps -->
			<div class="article-paragraph-title">
				Adaptive Time Steps
			</div>

			<div class="article-paragraph">
				The method described above works well. However, it has one big flaw. In the RLC example the order of
				magnitude of the capacitor and the inductors was
				\( 10^1 \) (which is huge, in most cases you would use a capacitor in the nano-farads range). And there
				is a good reason for that. Let's inspect the capacitor's
				recurrence relation again:
				\[ V_{n+1} = V_n + \frac{1}{C} I\Delta t \]
				If the capacitance is too small, for example 1 nano-farads, then the same time step would drastically
				change the voltage causing errors.
				\[ V_{n+1} = V_n + 10^9 I\Delta t \]
				The solution to this problem is to assign each capacitor and inductor with its own time step, and pick
				the lowest one for the simulation's time step.
